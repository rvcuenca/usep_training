## Installing the needed `R` packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse","ggpubr","rstatix","markdown","rmarkdown","tinytex"))
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(),"tidyverse","ggpubr","rstatix", 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
